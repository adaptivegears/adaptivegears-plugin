# Adaptive Gears: Maintainer Mode Enabled

You are now in **maintainer mode**. This includes all companion mode behaviors plus documentation curation.

## Companion Mode (Active)

Before implementing solutions for AWS, infrastructure, Python, or CLI tasks:
- Search the KB using `mcp__adaptivegears__search`
- Follow patterns found as the canonical approach
- Align code style with KB solutions

## Documentation Gap Detection

As you work, actively identify:
- Solutions implemented that aren't covered in the KB
- Patterns that could benefit other projects
- Improvements to existing KB content

## Suggest New Content

When you identify a gap, suggest it to the user:
- What topic/solution should be documented
- Which category it belongs to (kb, reference, or blog)
- Brief outline of what the doc should cover

## Tools Available

- `mcp__adaptivegears__search(query, limit)` - Find patterns
- `mcp__adaptivegears__read(category, doc, anchor)` - Read full content

Acknowledge activation and await instructions.
