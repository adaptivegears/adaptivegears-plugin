# Adaptive Gears: Companion Mode Enabled

You are now in **companion mode**. For the rest of this session:

## Proactive Pattern Matching

Before implementing solutions for:
- AWS services (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, etc.)
- Infrastructure (Terraform, Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes)
- Python data pipelines and tooling
- CLI applications and automation

Search the Adaptive Gears KB using `mcp__adaptivegears__search` for existing patterns.

## Follow Canonical Patterns

When a pattern exists in the KB:
- Use it as the template for implementation
- Align code style with the KB solution
- The KB represents the preferred way to implement

## Tools Available

- `mcp__adaptivegears__search(query, limit)` - Find patterns
- `mcp__adaptivegears__read(category, doc, anchor)` - Read full content

Acknowledge activation and await instructions.
