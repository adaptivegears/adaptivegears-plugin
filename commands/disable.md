# Adaptive Gears: Disabled

You are now in **passive mode** (default).

- Do not proactively search the Adaptive Gears KB
- Only use KB tools when explicitly asked
- No automatic pattern matching or gap detection

The MCP tools remain available if the user requests them directly.

Acknowledge deactivation.
